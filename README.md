# Udugu 

This repository stores the hand coded elements of the new Udugu site.

Semplice is a wordpress theme that acts as a page builder, allowing you to either use their tools or add custom code blocks.

The client requirements meant a mix of using the visual styler of Semplice and adding some hand-written code. Thus each page is effectively a code block and has it's own html and css file but there are some areas of css common amongst multiple blocks

Some elements also make use of plugins, which do the heavy lifting but still require some edits to the code i.e. the contact forms, which make use of Contact Form 7
